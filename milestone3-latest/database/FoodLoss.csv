Total losses due to  only harvesting and threshing losses at farmer?s fields  ranged between 5.60 and 16.14%. The differences in  postharvest losses among the farmers were due to  different level of skill of harvesting and threshing as well  as poor weed control. During the study it was observed  that the farmers? fields were engulfed in a lot of weeds.  Poor weed control is known to interfere with effectiveness  of harvesting (Al-Khatib, 1995)."

288,Ghana,,0113,Rice,2011,32.855,Milling,Processing,"The results of the milling analysis have been presented in  Table 6. The results showed that SB30 had marginally  higher milling yield (67.32%) than SB10 (66%).  However, the differences between the milling yields of  either the SB30 machine and the locally manufactured  milling machine or that of the SB10 machine and the  locally manufactured milling machine were significant.  The locally manufactured milling machine had the lowest  milling yield (63.33%). This implies that the locally  manufactured milling machine was less efficient as it also  resulted in higher percentage (52.7%) of broken grains  (Table 6). This implies that the local machine produced  less white rice per unit weight of paddy. This resulted in  less recoverable rice and therefore less revenue. SB30 is therefore superior to both SB10 and the Local machine in  terms of milling yield. In spite of the higher milling yield of  SB30, it is still lower than the 67.5% (2010 data)  considered to the lowest on record in the USA (Robinson,  2010). According to the author, this could lead to a shift  to selling more broken grains, consequently mean lower  prices. Norman and Otoo (2003) recommended that  improved dehulling and whitening machines should be  developed and tested for use in rice processing"

The placement of wrapped bananas on motorbikes and trucks caused physical injuries which affected the fingers on the outer row of the hands. After ripening the bruised area becomes hardened and creates avenues for entry of pathogens. Since bananas are climacteric, injury to the fruit causes ethylene production, increases respiration and water loss thereby shortening postharvest life.

Usually, no collective bargaining takes place on the price because each  farmer interacts individually with traders (brokers) and as a result, traders take advantage of  farmers by colluding to buy mangoes at prices lower than the prevailing market prices. This  exploitative tendency by buyers who offer very low prices was mentioned by 94 percent of farmers  as the major marketing challenge followed by delayed purchase after harvest (64%). This occurs  when brokers instruct farmers to harvest the mangoes promising to pick them up the next day but   41  then intentionally delay to do so. They then persuade farmers to sell their produce at lower prices  to avoid additional spoilage and loss given that mangoes are highly perishable. On-farm sorting,  grading and bulking of mango fruit is a common practice and is usually done by traders (brokers)  before buying them. They bring their own workers to the farm to harvest the fruit or by giving a  purchasing future date thus advising farmers on when to harvest. In both cases, the buyer meets the  labour costs involved. After sorting, damaged mangoes are rejected by buyers and farmers usually  have to find alternative use or ways to dispose the fruits. Those rejected because of fruit fly  infestation are buried in a deep hole.  The lack of good storage facilities at the farm level was also a major challenge that compelled  54 percent of farmers to sell their mangoes on the day of harvesting. Others (46%) kept them under a  makeshift shed to minimize sunburn, loss of moisture and accumulation of dust for a few days as  they waited to sell. In addition, most access roads to farms are passable only during the dry seasons  of the year but if there are heavy rains during the harvesting period, accessibility is impeded thus  contributing to post-harvest losses and a deterioration of quality leading to low selling prices. When  farmers were asked to rank the attributes that buyers considered as the most important when  selecting mangoes for purchase, 96 percent ranked fruit size first, followed closely by quality (92%),  colour as a maturity indicator (80%) and mango variety (42%). These results reveal the importance  of quality as a key attribute of marketable fruit. It is a compound attribute that refers to the lack of  external or internal damage or injury caused by insect pests, diseases, birds or mechanical damage."

To control insect infestation, at least 40g of 2% pirimiphos methyl would be needed for each bag of cobs. This would cost 4% of the cob value and would not completely eliminate the infestation or the damage."

454,Malawi,,0112,Maize (corn),1981,2.5,,Storage,Insects    The mean loss of maize sustained by all farmers in the SVADP was 3.2 ? 3.4% (SD) calculated by the SVW method and 1.8 ? 3.5% (SO) calculated by the count and weigh method (Table 4).
454,Malawi,The Shire Valley agricultural development area,0114,Sorghum,1981,2,,Storage,"This paper describes a survey of farm-level grain storage losses in Southern Malawi and the practical problems of  such surveys. The limitations of two different loss-assessment methods are discussed with regard to observed  discrepancies but it is concluded that losses in up to 10 months storage were 3% or less for maize and less than 2%  for sorghum. Such losses demonstrate the suitability of the grain varieties stored in the area to conservation during  the characteristic dry season. The considerable likelihood of greater losses with high-yielding but more susceptible  varieties, if these were introduced to the area, is indicated."

From the survey, the  losses in transportation of Mandarins from field to Krishi  Bazar was observed to be around 25% from all areas and  from Krishi Bazar to consuming markets/ terminal  markets was negligible (about 1%).

In  one way, survey was performed in Krishi Bazar  and in other; simulation of storage condition was  done in room. During survey, no cold storage  facility was reported. The dealers in Krishi Bazar  store oranges in cemented floor on plastics, straw  bed, doko, crates, and sacks and on plant leaves  bed. The oranges do not remain there for long  time. Only storage for 2 to 4 days was observed.  During this time, losses upto 5% was reported by  dealers. This loss was due to evaporation loss,  rottening, breakage, etc.For the assessment of  post harvest storage losses in room condition,  oranges were evaluated according to the following  categories:  a. Oranges without shrinkage or diseases and  disorders.  b. Oranges without pathological diseases.  c. Oranges without disorders or evaporative loss.  In every case, losses were evaluated after having  divided oranges visually. The results obtained are  shown in the Figure 1. They represent the  average of some measurements carried out in  December to January 2012 in storage. The total  loss during storage for 21 days was found to be  40.1%."

Crop losses occur during pre-harvest drying on the field were  caused by wild animals, birds and rodents. In worst cases, up to 32%  of maize-on-cobs could be lost to birds, monkeys, other rodents  before harvest, and through qualitative spoilage by mould and  fungi which could be extensive in wet conditions. Similar qualitative loss through aflatoxin contamination of maize and cassava in  Tanzania and Congo had been reported (Manjula et al., 2009). In  terms of proportion of matured crops, 15% was estimated as preharvest field loss for most grain and legume crops. The farmers  expressed their inability and skills to effectively prevent or control  field losses by pests and rodents. An estimated 1.5% of the maize,  millet, sorghum and groundnut outputs were estimated to be lost  during harvesting. Losses during transportation of the crops by  head-loads, on bicycles and other means were 2.5%. This compares  with 2.25% losses recorded during transportation of rice from the  field to the store and 1% from the store to the market for maize in  Madagascar (Hodges, 2012). An estimated loss of 13.4% for maize  (P ? 0.009), 20% for millet and sunflower, 18% for groundnut, 10% for  pigeon pea, 6% for sorghum and 5% for sesame occur when manual  methods of processing were used (Table 4). The losses were in form  of mechanical damage such as breakage, puncture, compression,  rupture, dent bruises, or spillages of the crops."
